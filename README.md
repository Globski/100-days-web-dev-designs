# 100 Days Web Development Journey & Designs

Welcome to my **100 Days Web Development** repository!  
This repo documents my daily progress learning web development, including projects, code snippets, and all related Figma designs.

## Whatâ€™s Inside?

- **Day-by-day code projects** showcasing HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and frameworks
- **Figma design files and screenshots** for UI/UX inspiration and implementation
- **Notes and resources** gathered during the journey

## How to Use This Repo

1. Browse through the daily folders named `day-01`, `day-02`, etc., to see code projects.
2. Check out the `designs` folder where I store exported Figma screenshots and links.
3. Each day includes a README with a summary, challenges, and learnings.
4. Feel free to explore the Figma links embedded for interactive design review.

## Why 100 Days?

Committing to 100 days helps build consistency and skills.

**Happy coding and designing! ðŸš€**
