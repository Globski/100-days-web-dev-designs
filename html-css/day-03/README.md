# Day-03 - Multi-Section Portfolio Page

## Description
This project is part of my 100 Days of Code challenge. On Day-03, I created a full portfolio homepage using only HTML and CSS. The page includes multiple sections: a hero section with an introduction and image, an "About Me" section, an "Experience & Education" timeline, a "Tools I Use" gallery, a "Projects" showcase with previews and buttons, and a "Contact" section with social media links. This layout uses modern CSS techniques including Flexbox and responsive design principles.

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the multi-section portfolio page. All layout and styling is done using linked CSS, with images stored in the `/images` directory.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3
