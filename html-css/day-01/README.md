# Day-01 - Logo and Text Positioning

## Description
This project is part of my web development practice focused on using HTML and CSS to build simple, responsive designs. I created a logo and positioned it at the top-left corner of the page along with a styled brand name. The project demonstrates the use of basic HTML, CSS flexbox, and absolute positioning.

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view the page.
