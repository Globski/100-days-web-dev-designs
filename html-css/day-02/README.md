# Day-02 - Responsive Navbar with Dropdown

## Description
This project builds on Day-01 by creating a responsive navigation bar using only HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. The navbar features a custom SVG logo and brand name ("Globski") aligned to the top-left, central navigation links (`Home`, `About`, `Projects`), a "Contact Me" button on the right, and a hamburger menu that toggles a dropdown with additional links (`Blogs`, `Services I Provide`, `Testimonials`). The layout uses CSS Flexbox for alignment and basic JavaScript for interactivity.

## How to Run
Open `index.html` in any modern web browser to view and interact with the responsive navigation bar.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5  
- CSS3  
- JavaScript (basic DOM manipulation)
